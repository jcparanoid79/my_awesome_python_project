# Specifications: Simple Web Calculator with Flask

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to create a simple web-based application that performs basic arithmetic calculations. The application will run on a server using the Flask framework and provide a user interface accessible via a web browser.

## 2. Goals

* To provide a functional online calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
* To demonstrate the use of the Flask framework for handling web requests and rendering dynamic content.
* To create a user-friendly interface for inputting numbers and selecting operations.

## 3. Key Features

* **User Interface:** A single web page accessible via a browser containing the calculator interface.
* **Number Input:** Two input fields allowing the user to enter numerical values.
* **Operation Selection:** A mechanism (e.g., dropdown or radio buttons) for the user to select one of the following operations:
    * Addition (+)
    * Subtraction (-)
    * Multiplication (*)
    * Division (/)
* **Calculation Trigger:** A button to submit the numbers and selected operation to the server.
* **Result Display:** The calculated result is displayed clearly on the same web page after submission.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Usability:** The interface should be intuitive and easy for a user to understand and operate.
* **Reliability:** The application should handle basic errors gracefully, such as attempting to divide by zero.
* **Accessibility:** Basic web accessibility considerations should be taken into account (e.g., clear labels for form fields).

## 5. Technical Considerations

* **Backend Framework:** Flask (Python).
* **Frontend:** Standard HTML forms and potentially minimal CSS for layout.
* **Language:** Python.
* **Dependencies:** Flask and its standard dependencies (like Jinja2 for templating).

## 6. Future Scope (Potential Enhancements)

* Adding more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponents, square root).
* Implementing a history of past calculations.
* Improving the user interface design with more comprehensive CSS.
* Adding input validation on the client-side using JavaScript.
* Handling more complex error scenarios.
* Adding unit tests for calculation logic and route handling.
